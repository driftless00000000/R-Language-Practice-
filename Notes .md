R Programming Language

R is an interpreted language that’s strictly case- and character-sensitive,
which means that you enter instructions that follow the specific syntactic
rules of the language into a console or command-line interface. The software then interprets and executes your code and returns any results.
R is what’s known as a high-level programming language. Level refers to the level of
abstraction away from the fundamental details of computer execution. That is, a lowlevel language will require you to do things such as manually manage the machine’s
memory allotments, but with a high-level language like R, you’re fortunately spared
these technicalities.
